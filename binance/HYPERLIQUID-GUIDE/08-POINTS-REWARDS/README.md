# Points, Rewards & Tokenomics Complete Guide

## Hyperliquid Points System

### What Are Points?
```
Pre-token incentive mechanism
Earned through platform usage
Likely convertible to tokens
Similar to other DEX launches

Historical comparisons:
- dYdX: Points → DYDX token
- Blur: Points → BLUR token
- Expected conversion: 1:1 or similar
```

### How Points Work
```
Accumulate daily based on:
1. Trading volume
2. HLP provision
3. Referrals
4. Early adoption
5. Vault creation/investment

Points = Activity × Multiplier × Time
```

## Earning Points

### Trading Volume Points

#### Calculation Method
```
Base Formula:
Points = Daily Volume × Base Rate × Multipliers

Example:
Trade $100,000 daily
Base rate: 1 point per $100
Daily points: 1,000
Monthly: 30,000 points
```

#### Volume Tiers
```
Tier 1: <$100k/day - 1x multiplier
Tier 2: $100k-500k/day - 1.2x multiplier
Tier 3: $500k-2M/day - 1.5x multiplier
Tier 4: $2M-10M/day - 2x multiplier
Tier 5: >$10M/day - 2.5x multiplier
```

#### Maker vs Taker
```
Maker orders: 1.5x points multiplier
Taker orders: 1x points multiplier

Why: Makers provide liquidity
Platform incentivizes liquidity
```

### HLP Points

#### Liquidity Provision Rewards
```
Points = HLP Amount × Days × Rate

Example:
$10,000 in HLP
Hold 30 days
Rate: 2 points per $100 per day
Points: 10,000/100 × 30 × 2 = 6,000
```

#### Consistency Bonus
```
Continuous HLP for:
30 days: 1.2x multiplier
60 days: 1.5x multiplier
90 days: 2x multiplier
180 days: 3x multiplier

Compounds with base points
```

### Referral Points

#### Referral Structure
```
Direct referrals:
- 10% of referee's points
- Lifetime duration
- No limit on referrals

Example:
Refer 10 users
Each earns 10,000 points/month
You earn: 10,000 additional points/month
```

#### Referral Quality
```
Active referrals worth more:
- Trading volume bonus
- HLP participation bonus
- Longevity bonus

Quality > Quantity
```

### Early Adopter Rewards

#### Genesis Period
```
First 3 months: 3x multiplier
Months 4-6: 2x multiplier
Months 7-12: 1.5x multiplier
After 1 year: 1x base rate

Early users significantly advantaged
```

#### Activity Streaks
```
Daily login: 1 point
7-day streak: 10 bonus
30-day streak: 100 bonus
90-day streak: 1,000 bonus

Small but cumulative
```

## Points Optimization Strategies

### Strategy 1: Volume Maximization
```
Focus: High-frequency trading
Method:
- Maker orders only (rebate + points)
- Tight spreads

```

### Strategy 2: HLP Focus
```
Focus: Passive accumulation
Method:
- Large HLP deposit
- Hold continuously
- Compound returns
- Minimal effort

Potential:
$100k HLP = 2,000 points/day
Monthly: 60,000 points
Lower but stable
```

### Strategy 3: Balanced Approach
```
Mix of:
- 50% capital in HLP
- 30% active trading
- 20% reserve

Benefits:
- Diversified points sources
- Risk distribution
- Consistent accumulation
```

### Strategy 4: Referral Network

- Build positions
- Establish presence
- Network building

This is the opportunity window
```

#### Risk/Reward Analysis
```
Risks:
- Platform risk

- Platform growth participation
```

### Post-Token Strategy

#### Expected Dynamics
```
Token launch:
- Initial pump likely
- Sell pressure from farmers
- Long-term value creation
- Utility development

Plan your exit/hold strategy
```

#### Value Accrual
```
Token value drivers:
- Platform revenue
- User growth
- TVL growth
- Feature expansion
- Market conditions
```

## Tax Implications

### Points Taxation
```
Current status: Grey area
Not tokens yet
No market value

```

### Record Keeping
```
Track:
- Points earned daily
- Source of points
- Activities performed
- Costs incurred

Prepare for eventual taxation
```
