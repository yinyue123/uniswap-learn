## Key Formulas Quick Reference

**Profit/Loss (Spot)**
```
P/L = (Sell Price - Buy Price) × Quantity - Fees
ROI% = (P/L / Initial Investment) × 100
```

**Leverage P/L (Futures)**
```
P/L = (Exit Price - Entry Price) × Position Size × Direction
ROE% = (P/L / Margin Used) × 100
```

**Liquidation Price (Long)**
```
Liq Price = Entry Price × (1 - 1/Leverage + Maintenance Margin Rate)
```
